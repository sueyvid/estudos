## What is Git?

Git is a popular version control system.

It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

Git is a tool that helps you:

- save and manage different versions of your files and code.
- work with others, keep track of changes, and undo mistakes.

It is used for:

- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration

## Key Git Concepts


- **Repository**: A folder where Git tracks your project and its history.
- **Clone**: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
- **Stage**: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
- **Commit**: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
- **Branch**: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
- **Merge**: Combine changes from different branches.
- **Pull**: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
- **Push**: Send your changes to a remote repository.

## Working with Git

- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a **Repository**
- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered **modified**
- You select the modified files you want to **Stage**
- The **Staged** files are **Committed**, which prompts Git to store a **permanent** snapshot of the files
- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
- You can revert back to any previous commit.
- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

## Why Git?

- Over 70% of developers use Git!
- Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
- Developers can see the full history of the project.
- Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.

## What is GitHub?

- Git is not the same as GitHub.
- GitHub makes tools that use Git.
- GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
- In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
